This project is an open repository for all reverse engineering related code snippets, scripts, plugins and applets.

See http://openrce.org

## Organization ##
The repository root (`trunk/`) should have a folder for each type of item (e.g. `idapython/`).

Each script/plugin/applet should be placed in a directory below the relevant item type (e.g. `idapython/parseExceptionHandlers`).

When adding new items, please take care to add them in the correct sub-folder. If the sub-folder doesn't exist, create it.

Also, please add a wiki page (use SnippetTemplate as a template) giving a short description of the item.

## Contact ##

The project is under the MIT "free-far-all" license, although snippet authors should feel free to license their snippets as they see fit.
